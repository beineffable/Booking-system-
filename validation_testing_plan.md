- Sanitized production data
- Limited external service integration
- Performance monitoring
- Integration test automation

### Production Simulation
- Full infrastructure deployment
- Complete external service integration
- Load testing with production-scale data
- Security scanning in isolated environment
- End-to-end test automation

## Testing Tools and Automation

### Automated Testing Framework
- Jest for JavaScript unit testing
- Pytest for Python backend testing
- Selenium for browser automation
- Appium for mobile testing
- Postman/Newman for API testing

### Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow integration
- Pre-merge test execution
- Code quality scanning
- Test coverage reporting
- Performance regression detection

### Monitoring and Observability
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Log aggregation with ELK stack
- Error tracking with Sentry

## Validation Criteria

### Acceptance Criteria
- All user stories pass defined acceptance criteria
- Zero critical or high-severity bugs
- Performance within defined thresholds
- Security vulnerabilities addressed
- Accessibility requirements met

### Quality Gates
- Code review approval
- Unit test coverage > 80%
- Integration test pass rate 100%
