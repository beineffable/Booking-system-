# AI-Assisted Trainer Tools Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation approach for AI-assisted tools designed to enhance trainer efficiency and effectiveness within the Training Club Fitness Platform. These tools will leverage AI and machine learning to automate planning, optimize scheduling, and provide real-time insights, aligning with the platform's automation-first principle.

## Core Components

### 1. AI Workout Planner

**Goal**: Automatically generate personalized and effective workout plans for members based on their goals, history, preferences, and performance data.

```python
class AIWorkoutPlanner:
    def __init__(self, db_connection, analytics_engine, exercise_library):
        self.db = db_connection

        modifications = []
        # Example Logic:
        # - If member reports fatigue, suggest reducing intensity or volume.
        # - If real-time feedback shows poor form on an exercise, suggest alternative or regression.
        # - If member is progressing faster than expected, suggest progression.

            return split[day_of_week % len(split)]
        elif "endurance" in goals:
            return "Cardio & Conditioning"
        else:
            return "General Fitness"

    def _populate_plan_with_exercises(self, plan_structure):
        """Select specific exercises, sets, reps, rest periods for each session"""
        # Use exercise library and progression model
        print("Populating plan with exercises...")

```

### 2. Intelligent Scheduler

**Goal**: Optimize class schedules and trainer assignments based on predicted attendance, member preferences, trainer availability, and business goals.

```python
class IntelligentScheduler:
    def __init__(self, db_connection, analytics_engine):
        self.db = db_connection

        end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=lookahead_days)
        
        # Get updated data
        recent_attendance = self.analytics.get_recent_attendance_trends()
        updated_trainer_availability = self.db.get_trainer_availability(start_date, end_date)
        member_feedback = self.db.get_recent_class_feedback()

        adjustments = []
        # Example Logic:
        # - If a class is consistently under-utilized, suggest reducing frequency or changing time.
        # - If a class is consistently over-capacity, suggest adding sessions or increasing capacity.
        # - If a trainer becomes unavailable, suggest replacements.

### 3. Real-time Feedback System (Conceptual)

**Goal**: Provide trainers with real-time insights during classes, potentially using sensors or member feedback, to adjust instruction and improve outcomes.

**Note**: Implementing true real-time feedback often requires hardware (wearables, cameras) and complex ML models (pose estimation, heart rate analysis). This section outlines a conceptual software framework.

```python
class RealTimeFeedbackSystem:
    def __init__(self, db_connection, analytics_engine, notification_service):
        self.db = db_connection
        self.analytics = analytics_engine
        self.notification_service = notification_service # To push feedback to trainer interface
        # Potential integration with sensor data streams or pose estimation models

    def process_class_data_stream(self, class_id, trainer_id, data_stream):
        """Process incoming data stream during a live class"""
        # Data stream could contain: member heart rates, movement data (if sensors), video feed
        
        # Analyze data for key events or insights
        insights = self._analyze_stream(data_stream)
        
        # If significant insights found, notify trainer
        if insights:
            self.notification_service.send_trainer_alert(trainer_id, class_id, insights)
            # Log insights for post-class review
            self.db.log_real_time_insight(class_id, insights)

    def provide_post_session_summary(self, class_id, trainer_id):
        """Generate a summary for the trainer after a class session"""
        class_data = self.db.get_class_session_data(class_id)
        member_performance = self.analytics.get_class_member_performance(class_id)
        logged_insights = self.db.get_real_time_insights_for_class(class_id)
        
        summary = {
            "overall_engagement": self._calculate_engagement(member_performance),
            "performance_highlights": self._find_performance_highlights(member_performance),
            "areas_for_improvement": self._identify_improvement_areas(member_performance, logged_insights),
            "key_insights_from_session": logged_insights
        }
        
        # Store summary
        self.db.save_post_session_summary(class_id, trainer_id, summary)
        return {"success": True, "summary": summary}

    def _analyze_stream(self, data_stream):
        """Analyze real-time data stream for actionable insights"""
        # Complex analysis logic - depends heavily on data source
        # Example: Detect if average heart rate exceeds target zone
        # Example: Use pose estimation to detect common form errors
        insights = []
        # Placeholder:
        if data_stream.get("avg_heart_rate", 120) > 160: # Example threshold
            insights.append({"type": "high_intensity", "message": "Average heart rate is high. Consider a brief recovery."}) 
        return insights
        
    def _calculate_engagement(self, performance_data):
        # Calculate overall class engagement score
        return 0.75 # Placeholder
        
    def _find_performance_highlights(self, performance_data):
        # Identify members who exceeded expectations or hit PRs
        return [] # Placeholder
        
    def _identify_improvement_areas(self, performance_data, insights):
        # Suggest areas for the trainer to focus on next time
        return [] # Placeholder
```

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Trainer Dashboard Widgets

- **AI Workout Planner**: Interface to generate plans for members, view suggested plans, and approve/modify them.
- **Intelligent Scheduler**: View optimized schedule drafts, compare scenarios, approve schedules, and see suggested adjustments.
- **Real-time Class View (Conceptual)**: Dashboard displayed during class showing key metrics (if available), alerts from the feedback system, and quick actions (e.g., modify exercise).
- **Post-Class Summary**: Display the automated summary after each class session.

### 2. Member Profile Integration

- Display AI-generated workout plans to members.
- Allow members to provide feedback on workouts.

### 3. Admin Configuration

- Settings to configure the objectives and constraints for the Intelligent Scheduler.
- Options to enable/disable specific AI features.
- Management of the Exercise Library used by the AI Planner.

## Database Schema Updates

## Integration Points

- **Analytics Engine**: AI tools heavily rely on analytics for member data, performance history, and demand prediction.
- **Automation Engine**: Insights from AI tools can trigger automated communications or tasks (e.g., notify member about a new plan, assign trainer to review plan).
- **Member Portal**: Display workout plans, allow feedback.
- **Trainer Portal**: Primary interface for interacting with AI tools.
- **External Data (Optional)**: Potential integration with wearable data streams for real-time feedback.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the `AIWorkoutPlanner` backend logic, including the exercise library and planning model.
2. Develop the `IntelligentScheduler` backend, potentially integrating an optimization library.
3. Define the framework for the `RealTimeFeedbackSystem` (initially focusing on post-class summaries).
4. Update the database schema.
5. Implement the frontend components for trainers and admins.
6. Integrate AI tools with existing platform modules.
7. Test AI features with simulated and real data.
